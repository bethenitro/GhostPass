# The Senate Governance Engine Configuration
# PATENT COMPLIANT: Role-based, not vendor-based governance
# 
# CORE DOCTRINE COMPLIANCE:
# 1. Role-based, not vendor-based: Senate "seats" are roles, any LLM can occupy a role
# 2. Procedural governance, not voting math: No averaging, no majority shortcuts, escalation > confidence
# 3. Human is ON THE RAIL, not in the loop: Humans do not approve actions live, veto is async/absolute
# 4. Hallucinations are neutralized: Invalid output = ABSTAIN, failed calls = ABSTAIN
# 5. Zero persistence: Raw prompts never stored, hashes + verdicts only

# SENATORS: Role-based seats that any LLM can occupy
